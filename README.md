# nf-core Modules
Modules directory for custom nf-core modules that cannot be added to main nf-core

These modules are created using the nf-core tooling but were not specifically developed for [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/). This is either due to lack of time to meet all requirements, lack of suitable test data or the module violates nf-core rules (eg. use of pipes!). 

## Requirements
The nf-core package is a requirement for development and importing these modules into your own workflow. As too is [Nextflow](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation)
Simply:
```bash
pip install nf-core
```
or set up a specific conda env:
```bash
conda create --name nf-core python=3.11 nf-core nextflow
conda activate nf-core
```
See the official [nf-core/tools repo](https://github.com/nf-core/tools) for actual details

## Usage

### -- TODO --
I will update this with specific details when I have them but for now refer to below:

This is inspired by the [EBI-Metagenomics team](https://github.com/EBI-metagenomics/nf-modules).
